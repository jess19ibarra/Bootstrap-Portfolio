                            <p>Hey Y'all! My name is Jessica Ibarra pronounced (jeh-si-kuh i-bah-ruh). I prefer to be
                                called
                                "Jess"
                                because its shorter and I think Jessica sounds weird. Alot of people tend to pronounce
                                my
                                name
                                with a
                                "Y" instead of a "J" and then attempt to say my last name and completely butcher it. Now
                                that
                                you've
                                learned how to correctly pronounce my name, let me share a little synopsis about me.</p>

                            <p> I'm not the most intresting person but I do know how to have a good time. Let's see I am
                                26
                                years young
                                and have been living in Texas all of my life! I grew up in a hispanic household with
                                wonderful
                                parent
                                and 2 brothers. I am the middle child, 4 years younger than my older brother and 18
                                years
                                older
                                than my
                                little brother. I was
                                lucky to have a great childhood without struggles. After I graduated highschool in 2011
                                I
                                decided to go
                                to community college. I studied for a couple years but decided to make
                                work and not finish school. Fast foward to 2015 I found out I was pregnant and became a
                                mother
                                in 2016
                                to
                                the cutie in the picture. Her name is Emma and she is
                                my pride and joy, my little sour patch kid. Emma is 3 going on 13... send help! Totally
                                kidding,
                                she is
                                beautiful, brave, and brilliant. She is what keeps me going everyday and the reason I am
                                taking
                                this
                                course. Most days I spend with family and friends. We like to have get togethers, watch
                                sporting
                                events,
                                concerts or just have a good time. I love listening
                                to a variety of music, and just jam out. I love to travel, I just wish I had tons of
                                money
                                so it
                                could
                                happen more often.</p>

                            <p>I currently have a full time job as a Business Analyst for a healthcare company. I have
                                been
                                working in
                                healthcare for 7 years now. Which is why I am seeking a career chang and taking course.

                                is
